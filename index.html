			<h3>
				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Major peaks in COVID-19 cases occur around January each year (excluding 2020), indicating a seasonal
					trend.</li>
				<li>The largest peak appears in January 2022, representing the Omicron surge, which surpasses all
					previous waves.</li>
				<li>The January 2022 surge is still increasing, with no clear sign of decline.</li>
				<li>Case numbers fluctuate more during the winter of 2020–2021 compared to other periods.</li>
				<li>Case counts decline during the summer months, as seen in mid-2020 and mid-2021.</li>
				<li>Smaller peaks are visible in August 2020, May 2021, and September 2021.</li>
				<li>After the May 2021 peak, cases drop significantly, but after September 2021, they remain relatively
					high.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>
				Design Critique:
			</h3>

			<p>The visualization effectively captures the alarming rise in COVID-19 cases during the Omicron wave,
				making the crisis immediately apparent to a broad audience. Published in The New York Times, the graphic
				was designed for a general readership rather than a technical or scientific audience, meaning
				accessibility and impact were key priorities. The spiral format intuitively conveys the recurring nature
				of COVID-19 waves, reinforcing the idea of seasonal surges in a way that is more engaging than a
				conventional line chart. By positioning the Omicron peak at the outermost part of the spiral, the design
				ensures that the most pressing takeaway: the sheer scale of this wave is the most visually dominant
				feature. The use of a radial scale helps minimize clutter while still showing the long-term trend, and
				the labeled year markers with arrows effectively guide readers outward from the center, mirroring the
				pandemic’s progression.</p>

			<p>However, while the spiral design is visually striking, it introduces interpretative challenges that could
				hinder the intended audience’s understanding. The radial layout inherently exaggerates differences in
				magnitude, making the Omicron peak appear even more dramatic than it already is. Additionally, the 2020
				data, which is smaller and more compressed toward the center, is harder to read, potentially downplaying
				the severity of earlier waves. This distortion makes it difficult to accurately compare case levels
				across different periods, a crucial consideration for policymakers or readers trying to assess
				historical trends. The absence of clear month demarcations further reduces temporal precision, which
				could make it harder for readers to connect the case trends to real-world events, such as vaccine
				rollouts or new variant emergences.
			</p>

			<p>Given the urgency of the message at the time of publication, the designers likely prioritized an
				emotionally impactful visualization over precise data interpretation. However, alternative design
				choices could have improved both impact and clarity. A more traditional time-series chart or small
				multiples could have preserved the dramatic case increase while maintaining more accurate temporal and
				quantitative comparisons. Additionally, incorporating color-coding to distinguish different years or to
				encode case severity could have helped readers more easily track trends over time without relying solely
				on radial distance. For instance, using a gradient to indicate case counts from lighter shades for lower
				case numbers to darker or more intense colors for peak periods could improve the readability of the
				scale. If the goal was to emphasize the cyclical nature of COVID-19 waves, a radial layout could still
				be effective, but adjustments, such as a logarithmic scale or clearer monthly markers, would make the
				visualization more informative without sacrificing its dramatic effect.</p>

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="figures/sketch1.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This sketch modifies the original spiral visualization by replacing the filled area with radial
					spikes to represent daily case counts more explicitly. It retains the cyclical nature of COVID-19
					waves while improving readability of magnitude differences over time. Inspiration from <a
						href="https://medium.com/select-from-data/the-new-york-times-viz-that-divided-datatwitter-8a406241bb21">The
						New York Times viz that divided #DataTwitter</a>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Instead of a filled-in shaded area, spikes are used to indicate daily cases, making it easier to see
					fluctuations within each wave. This reduces the exaggeration caused by the previous thick bands.
				</li>
				<li>The spikes help provide a more proportional sense of case count differences between years,
					addressing the issue of visual distortion in the original design.</li>
				<li>Vertical and horizontal dashed lines were added to divide months more clearly, improving temporal
					precision and making it easier to track trends over time.</li>
				<li>Retains the compelling cyclical metaphor of pandemic waves while enhancing clarity and
					comparability.</li>
				<li>While spikes improve data readability, they might introduce clutter. The next sketch could explore
					color or gradient-based approaches for additional clarity and grouping of waves.</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="figures/sketch2.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This sketch refines the spiral design by incorporating monthly demarcations and color-coded case
					severity, improving temporal readability while retaining the cyclical representation of COVID-19
					waves. Inspiration from <a href="https://nathanaelj.github.io/portfolio/A3">Nathanael Jenkins</a>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Each month is explicitly labeled, making it easier to track the progression of the pandemic and
					connect case surges to real-world events. The dotted radial gridlines provide a reference for time
					without overwhelming the design.</li>
				<li>Shaded regions in red represent higher case counts, with darker shades indicating more severe peaks.
					This helps the audience quickly identify surges while preserving visual clarity.</li>
				<li>Unlike the original visualization, which exaggerated outer waves, this design keeps the width of the
					spiral bands relatively consistent, reducing distortion and making different waves more directly
					comparable.</li>
				<li>A simple visual key in the top left explains the relationship between color intensity and case
					numbers, improving accessibility for non-expert readers.</li>
				<li>The spiral still introduces some distortion in comparing different years. The next iteration could
					explore a more traditional time-series layout while maintaining some cyclical elements to emphasize
					seasonality.</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="figures/sketch3.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This sketch replaces the spiral format with a small multiples layout, using a grid of mini line
					charts to allow for clearer temporal comparisons of COVID-19 case trends across different years and
					months. Inspiration from <a href="https://infovis-a3.vercel.app/">Ryan Yen</a>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Each row represents a month (January to December), while each column represents a year (2020, 2021,
					2022). This makes it easier to compare seasonal patterns across different years without the
					distortion caused by a spiral layout.</li>
				<li>By breaking the data into smaller charts, trends become more visible at a monthly resolution.
					Readers can quickly identify which months had the highest spikes across different years.</li>
				<li>The rightmost column provides a shared Y-axis scale, ensuring that case numbers are interpreted
					consistently across all mini charts. This solves the issue of exaggerated peaks in the original
					visualization.</li>
				<li>The format retains the ability to highlight seasonal COVID-19 waves (e.g., winter surges) while
					offering a clearer, more structured way to track trends over time.</li>
				<li>While this design improves accuracy, it may lack the immediate visual impact of the spiral. The next
					iteration could explore ways to emphasize extreme peaks (e.g., using color intensity or annotations)
					while preserving the clarity of small multiples.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Final Visualization Design</h2>

			<figure>

				<figcaption>
					This calendar heat map visualizes daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. from 2020 to 2022,
					using color intensity to indicate case severity. By structuring the data into a familiar calendar
					format, this design enables clear temporal comparisons while preserving the cyclical nature of
					COVID-19 waves.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<h3>Reflection</h3>

			<p>
				This final design aims to improve both readability and accuracy by replacing the spiral format with a
				calendar heat map, which better preserves temporal resolution and scale integrity. The main objective is
				to highlight seasonality in COVID-19 case trends while allowing direct comparisons between years and
				months. By structuring the data as a sequence of individual days, this visualization enables readers to
				pinpoint when case surges occurred and how they evolved over time. The calendar layout retains the idea
				of cyclical waves but removes the distortion introduced by radial scaling. Additionally, the use of
				color gradients—ranging from light yellow to deep red—effectively conveys the severity of case spikes,
				particularly the Omicron wave in early 2022, without the exaggeration caused by the original spiral
				format. The inclusion of a consistent legend and labels for weekdays further enhances accessibility,
				ensuring that even non-expert readers can interpret the data intuitively. </p>
			<p>
				The iterative redesign process revealed key trade-offs between emotional impact and data accuracy. The
				original spiral visualization was striking but introduced distortion that made it difficult to compare
				different waves quantitatively. The first sketch attempted to mitigate this by replacing filled areas
				with spikes, improving clarity but increasing visual clutter. The second sketch incorporated explicit
				month markers and color-coding to enhance interpretability while keeping the spiral structure, but it
				still suffered from inherent distortions. The small multiples approach in the third sketch successfully
				preserved temporal resolution and comparability, but it lacked the strong visual emphasis on extreme
				peaks. The final calendar heat map strikes a balance between emphasizing major surges and maintaining
				precision, offering a clear, data-driven representation of COVID-19 waves. However, this design does
				somewhat downplay long-term trends by focusing on daily fluctuations. Future iterations could explore
				hybrid models, such as combining heat maps with trend lines, to further enhance insight into long-term
				pandemic patterns.
